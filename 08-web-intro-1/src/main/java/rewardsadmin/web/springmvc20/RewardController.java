/**
 * A Spring MVC controller for managing reward entities on behalf of authorized user requests.
 * This controller is a MultiActionController, encapsulating all reward controller logic in
 * distinct handler methods. Each handler method performs a distinct user interface action
 * and is mapped to a URL by convention. The URL mapping conventions are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>GET /reward/new -> calls {@link #newForm(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}
 * to setup and render a form to create a new reward.
 * <li>POST /reward/new -> calls {@link #create(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}
 * to create the new reward entity and save it to the database.
 * <li>GET /reward/show/${confirmationNumber} -> calls {@link #show(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}
 * to display the details about the reward with the confirmation number.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * To carry out its actions, this controller depends on services in the application layer. These services are injected
 * into this controller using constructor-dependency injection.
